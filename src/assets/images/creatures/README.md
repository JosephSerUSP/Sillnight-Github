# Creature Sprites

This folder will contain per-species sprite images. Files are named after their creature IDs
from `Data.creatures` (e.g., `pixie.png`). The repository omits the actual PNG sprites; add
them locally when developing. Sprites should be sized for billboard rendering; the Three.js
battle scene scales sprites to a 3×3 world unit square.
