# Game Assets

The `src/assets` directory organizes all of the non-code resources the game will need.

- `images/` — visual assets such as sprites, UI art, and environment tiles.
- `audio/` — music, sound effects, and voice clips.
- `data/` — supplemental JSON or configuration files that ship with assets.

Each asset type can grow its own subfolders; for example, creature sprites live in `images/creatures/`.

Binary assets are not included in the repository. Add your working copies of PNG sprites or other
raster exports locally within these folders when developing the game.
