# Campaign: The Aetherial Fracture

## Narrative Overview
The world of Oakhaven is slowly being consumed by the "Aetherial Fracture," a tear in the fabric of reality located deep within the Ancient Spire. The player controls a band of "Stabilizers," mercenaries hired by the Guild to venture into the Spire and seal the fracture.

As they descend, they discover that the Spire is not just a dungeon, but a prison for a cosmic entity known as "The Unbound," which is manipulating the layout of the spire and the creatures within it.
